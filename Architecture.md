Required Tech Stack for the Process Scheduler Simulator Application:

1.Backend Server:

Node.js: Used to create the server-side application.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to handle routing and serving static files.
Child Process Module: Used to execute the C++ program from the Node.js server.

2.Frontend:

HTML: Markup language for creating the structure of web pages.
CSS: Stylesheet language for styling HTML elements.
JavaScript (Vanilla): Used for client-side scripting to handle user interactions and make AJAX requests.
May also use React.js

3.Communication:

HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol used for communication between the frontend and backend.
AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML): Used in the frontend JavaScript to make asynchronous requests to the backend server without reloading the page.

4.C++ Program:

Executable File: The C++ program for process scheduling simulation is compiled into an executable file that can be executed by the operating system.

5.Package Management:

npm(Node Package Manager): Used for installing and managing Node.js packages, such as Express.js.
6. Development Environment:

Text Editor or IDE: Used for writing code. Examples include Visual Studio Code.
This architecture provides a clear separation between the frontend and backend components of the application, making it modular and easier to maintain. The frontend interacts with the backend server via HTTP requests, while the backend server handles the simulation logic and serves static files.
